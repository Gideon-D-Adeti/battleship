# Battleship

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports, please open an issue or create a pull request.

## Note

This project was built as part of my web development journey on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

I decided not to complete the project fully. Maybe I'll finish it up in the future. The game is still playable, though, with the player and computer ships placed in predetermined positions. Here are some features that are left to be implemented:

- Drag and drop functionality to allow the player to place their ships.
- Functionality to allow the player to randomly place their ships.
- Adding sound effects.
- Functionality to mark verified empty cells.
- Functionality to randomly place computer ships before the game starts.
